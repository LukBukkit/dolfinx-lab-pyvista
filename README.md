# dolfinx-lab-pyvista

Due to an issue ([#2151](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx/issues/2151)) the [pyvista](https://docs.pyvista.org/) 
dependency is not included in the [dolfinx/lab](https://hub.docker.com/r/dolfinx/lab) Docker image.

This image includes the missing dependency, but it won't be updated.
Use at your own risk!
